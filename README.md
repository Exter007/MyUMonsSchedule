# MyUMonsSchedule
### Use MyUMonsSchedule python script to send a screenshot by email (Gmail) of your MyUMons schedule.
#### If you use it on Windows, take care to download geckodriver (and add it to PATH*) : https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
1) You must modify the script to **CHANGE** the global vars.
2) **DON'T FORGET** to change your Gmail/Google config only for the **SENDER**. There are only 2 easy steps to do.
3) You are prompted for your Gmail password (*sender only*) while running the script.

\* Just run it in the MyUMonsSchedule folder. You can close the window right after.
